## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I would like to continue my focus on making responsive websites. I would also like to learn more about Tailwind CSS and how to use it more efficiently.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS From Scratch](https://www.traversymedia.com/tailwind-css-course) - Traversy Media's Tailwind CSS course was very helpful in learning the basics of Tailwind CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone who is just starting out with Tailwind CSS.
- [Tailwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com) - The Tailwind Docs are very helpful when you need to look up a class name or a utility. I would recommend using the docs as a reference when you are working on a project.
